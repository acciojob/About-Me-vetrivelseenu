		<h3>About me</h3>
		<p>Myself Vetrivel from ParangiPettai, Tamil NƒÅdu. I have a degree in mechanical engineering and I graduated in 2019. I have no interest in anything since I believe that everything will be difficult, although I have gained some knowledge in my recent three years of practical experience. With my prior experiences, I could comprehend practical Life. Nothing worthwhile in life is accomplished without pain and anything temporary if it exists. Money is necessary for addition to virtue since no one will appreciate us if we have only virtue or if we have also only money. In the past three years, I have learned this. So, throughout the past few months, I started seeking anything to do. I started searching for which field we can achieve and show our full potential then I found that the Information Technology field is very important to our world then I started searching about full-stack web development and now I am learning a Full Stack web development course at ACCIOJOB.</p>
